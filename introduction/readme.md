# The Nature of Code - P5

The below is the list of the different sections that will be covered when it comes to P5.js, We will start with the Random Walker as part of the introduction.

What is a the walker? So, if you are standing in the middle of a beam for example and a coin is flipped heads you take a step forward, tails you take a step backwards.  

The path of the random walker is a series of random steps, back, forward
to the right side or the left side.  The random walker can be class also as the drunken man.  

The examples below show different versions of the Random Walker.
