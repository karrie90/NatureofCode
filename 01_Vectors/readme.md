# The Nature of Code - Vectors
What is a Vector, Vector can mean a lot of different things, for example
Vector can be a rock band name or breakfast cereal.  What we are going to look at
is what is a vector in P5.

The example of an arrow being drawn in a direction where it is
pointing the Magnitude would be the length of the arrow.
