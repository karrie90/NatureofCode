[Oscillation - Nature of Code](./)

# The Nature of Code - Oscillation
What is Oscillation, it is the repetitive variation in time or measurement about a central value (the point of equilibrium) between two or more different states.  

Trigonometry is a mathematical function used with right triangles. Trigonometry within p5 is giving a lot of tools to play with when you think about angles and angular velocity and then we can add acceleration.

Within Trigonometry we learn about sine and cosine when this function is used properly we can design some nice effects for example ease-in, ease-out wave pattern.

The below section is what we will be explained in relation to Oscillation.
